Create a React application that allows users to:
Enter a task into an input field.
Add the task to a to-do list when a button is clicked.
Display the list of tasks dynamically below the input field.
Requirements:
The input field should be cleared after adding a task.
If the user clicks "Add Task" with an empty input, an alert should be shown.
Each task should have a button to remove it from the list.
Example Output:
The user types a task in the input field, clicks "Add Task," and the task is added to the list below.
Clicking the "Remove" button next to a task will remove it from the list.
